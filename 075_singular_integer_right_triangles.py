PROBLEM: 
Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1,500,000 can exactly 
one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?

APPROACH:
Conditions for integer-sided right triangle:
a < b < c
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
L = a + b + c
From Euclid's formular we derive that if m, n are two coprime numbers and of them is even, 
then a primitve Pythagorean triple can be generated as follows:
a = m^2 - n^2
b = 2 * m * n
c = m^2 + n^2
m > n > 0
In order to find non-primitive triples, we simply multiply every side with a factor k.
